Hi, my name is Chenxi. 

I am a newly graduated master's student in the computational biology and bioinformatics program at ETH Zurich under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Niko Beerenwinkel. Prior to my Master's degree, I earned my Bachelor's degree in computer science and bioinformatics at Harbin Institute of Technology.

My research interest is developing novel algorithms and statistical models for disease evolution. In my master thesis, "Sampling-MetMHN," we pioneered a groundbreaking cancer progression model that models the genetic progression of both primary tumors and metastases. We use this model to unravel critical genetic interactions that may drive the metastatic process. 

Besides bioinformatics, I enjoy the art of photography. I find joy in capturing semi-professional portraits for friends and family, embarking on photographic journeys during hikes, and delving into the mesmerizing world of astrophotography. Apart from taking pictures of my own, I enjoy learning the history of photography and going to galleries.
