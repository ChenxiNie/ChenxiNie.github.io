Hi, my name is Chenxi. 

I recently earned my Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Master's from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETHz), supervised by Prof.Dr. Niko Beerenwinkel. Before ETHz, I earned my Bachelor's in bioinformatics from Harbin Institute of Technology.

My research passion lies in modeling disease dynamics, such as cancer progression, as random processes. In my master thesis, "Sampling-MetMHN," we pioneered a groundbreaking cancer progression model that models the genetic progression of both primary tumors and metastases. We use this model to unravel critical genetic interactions that may drive the metastatic process. 

Besides bioinformatics, I enjoy the art of photography. I find joy in capturing semi-professional portraits for friends and family, embarking on photographic journeys during hikes, and delving into the mesmerizing world of astrophotography. Apart from taking pictures of my own, I enjoy learning the history of photography and going to galleries.
